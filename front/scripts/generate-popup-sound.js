// This is a script to generate a popup sound

// on how to create a simple popup sound

console.log(`
To create a popup sound:

1. Use an online sound generator like https://onlinetonegenerator.com/
2. Generate a short beep sound:
   - Frequency: 800-1000 Hz
   - Duration: 0.2-0.3 seconds
   - Waveform: Square or Sine
   - Add a slight fade-out

3. Save it as 'popup.mp3' in the public/sounds directory

Alternative: Use a stock sound effect from sites like:
- https://freesound.org/
- https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/
- https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/

Look for keywords like "alert", "notification", "beep", or "popup"
